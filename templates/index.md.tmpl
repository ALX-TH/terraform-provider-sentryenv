# Sentry Environments Terraform Provider  

Set up Sentry Project Environments.  

The Terraform provider for Sentry Environment allows teams to create Sentry environments via their [API interface](https://docs.sentry.io/api/).  

This provider can be used together with the [jianyuan/sentry](https://github.com/jianyuan/terraform-provider-sentry) provider to create the ***sentry_issue_alert*** resource.  
The provider publishes demo events into Sentry for the specified environments, which triggers the creation of those environments.
